# Preparing for Hackathons
If you are going to attend a hackathon, you can get more from the experience by doing a bit of prep work. Hopefully each hackathon will be unique, but there are some common steps involved with most of them.

## Research Projects
Hackathons generally have a common theme that connects a variety of open data sets, and attendees divide into groups of various skill levels and backgrounds to tackle projects based on that theme. You will typically find starter ideas for projects on the hackathons website or communications. You don't always have to sign up for a project ahead of time, but thinking about what types of problems you'd like to solve or what data you'd like to look at is a great way to get informed and excited about the event.

## Choose a Role
One of the best parts of hackathons is being able to be part of a cross section of minds motivated to solve real-world problems. Community Organizers, Technologists, Artists, Educators, Government Leaders, and more come together to user modern technology to help the world.
